# File Finder Perl, Ruby and Bash

Uses perl, ruby and bash

3 scripts that essentially find every ".conf" on a computer. 1 in perl, 1 in ruby and 1 in bash.

Bash:
1. Compile and run file with ./heelo_world.sh
NOTE: you may need to give yourself permission first (on Linux was using chmod).

Ruby:
1. Compile and run file with ruby search.rb

Perl:
1. Compile and run file with perl searchpearl.pl
